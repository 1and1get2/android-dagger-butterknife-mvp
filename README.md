# Android Dagger ButterKnife MVP

This is a sample app that is part of an 
[article](https://proandroiddev.com/how-to-android-dagger-2-10-2-11-butterknife-mvp-part-1-eb0f6b970fd) 
about how to build Android applications using 
[Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger) with the 
[Dagger Android extension](https://github.com/google/dagger/tree/master/java/dagger/android), 
[Butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife), and Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern 
with support for Singleton, PerActivity, PerFragment, and PerChildFragment scopes.

This demonstrates dagger.android, butterknife, and MVP setup using 3 examples:

1. Activity with 1 fragment.
2. Activity with 2 fragments.
3. Activity with 1 fragment with 1 child fragment.

Read the blogs for a complete walkthrough of this app:

1. Creating a project, from scratch, using the new Dagger.Android (2.11) dependency injection 
   framework with support for @Singleton, @PerActivity , @PerFragment, and @PerChildFragment scopes.

2. Using Butterknife (8.7) to replace a lot of handwritten boilerplate view binding code.

3. Restructuring the code to Model-View-Presenter (MVP) to increase testability, maintainability, 
   and scalability. *(coming soon)*

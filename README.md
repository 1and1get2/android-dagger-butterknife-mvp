# Android Dagger ButterKnife MVP

This is a sample app that is part of a blog post about how to build Android applications using 
[Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger) with the 
[Dagger Android extension](https://github.com/google/dagger/tree/master/java/dagger/android), 
[Butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife), and Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern with
support for Singleton, PerActivity, PerFragment, and PerChildFragment scopes.

This demonstrates dagger.android, butterknife, and MVP setup using 3 examples:

1. Activity with 1 fragment.
2. Activity with 2 fragments.
3. Activity with 1 fragment with 1 child fragment.

/**
 * Abstract (Dialog)Fragment for all (Dialog)Fragments and child (Dialog)Fragments to extend.
 * This contains some boilerplate dependency injection code and activity {@link Context}.
 * <p>
 * <b>WHY EXTEND AppCompatDialogFragment?</b>
 * {@link AppCompatDialogFragment}s are simple extensions of Fragments. DialogFragments can be shown
 * as a dialog floating above the current activity or be embedded into views like regular fragments.
 * Therefore, supporting both Fragments and DialogFragments for dependency injection can simply be
 * achieved by having the base fragment class (this) extend DialogFragment instead of Fragment.
 * We could have separate base classes for Fragments and DialogFragments but that would produce
 * duplicate code. See See https://github.com/vestrel00/android-dagger-butterknife-mvp/pull/64
 * <p>
 * Note that as of Dagger 2.12, the abstract base framework type
 * {@link dagger.android.support.DaggerAppCompatDialogFragment} has been introduced for subclassing
 * if so desired.
 * <p>
 * <b>DEPENDENCY INJECTION</b>
 * We could extend {@link dagger.android.support.DaggerAppCompatDialogFragment} so we can get the
 * boilerplate dagger code for free. However, we want to avoid inheritance (if possible and it is in
 * this case) so that we have to option to inherit from something else later on if needed.
 * <p>
 * <b>VIEW BINDING</b>
 * This fragment handles view bind and unbinding.

         * caveat to this approach is that views, listeners, and resources bound by
         * Butterknife will be null until onViewStatedRestored. Just be careful not to use any
         * objects bound using Butterknife before onViewStateRestored.
         *
         * Fragments that do not return a non-null View in onCreateView results in onViewCreated
         * and onViewStateRestored not being called. This means that Butterknife.bind will not get
         * called, which is completely fine because there is no View to bind. Furthermore, there is
         * no need to check if getView() returns null here because this lifecycle method only gets
         * called with a non-null View.
